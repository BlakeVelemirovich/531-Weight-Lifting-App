WIP - A fullstack app written in C# (ASP.NET Core) and Angular (TypeScript) with a Postgres persistence layer that will be delivered via a Docker compose container. 

The App will handle progressive overload for my workout routines. It will handle the calculations for multiple exercises, and allow the user to view history, add new user profiles (With proper authentication and authorizaton), and modify routines.
